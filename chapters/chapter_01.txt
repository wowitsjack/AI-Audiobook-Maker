Chapter 1: The Beginning

It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. The wind whipped through the empty streets, carrying with it the scent of change and possibility. Sarah walked slowly down the cobblestone path, her footsteps echoing in the silence.

She had always known this day would come, though she never imagined it would arrive so suddenly. The letter in her pocket crinkled as she walked, its contents still fresh in her mind. Everything she thought she knew about her life was about to change.

The old oak tree at the end of the street stood tall and majestic, its branches reaching toward the gray sky like gnarled fingers. This had been her favorite spot as a child, a place where dreams felt possible and the world seemed full of wonder.

Now, as she stood beneath its protective canopy, Sarah felt the weight of destiny pressing down upon her shoulders. The adventure that lay ahead would test everything she believed about herself and the world around her.
